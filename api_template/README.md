# API Template (Flask)

This is a template you can use/follow to make a simple Flask Microservice. It may need adjusting based on your needs.

Simply put, you should be able to use this template by importing your original python file and modifying the other files/folders to setup the API endpoints.

For more guidance, you can also refer to the ETA API for more guidance as that follows a very similar format.
